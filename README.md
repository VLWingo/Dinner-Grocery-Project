# Dinner-Grocery-Project
Python project to help meal plan using a variety of methods, including random generation.

/Python with Pandas
"Master Program.py" contains the functions for loading .csv's and the interactive form of the program, 
offering complete randomized results, partially randomized, or complete user-decided results. Then users 
can interact with 'grocery list' that consolidates the resources needed and estimate the cost of the results.

"dinner_Generator.py" handles the functions related to the "dinner" side of the project: randomly finding results 
that fit the user's desires (# of days, # of "difficult" recipes) and conform to predetermined parameters, testing 
those parameters, etc.

"ingredients_Generator.py" handles the "grocery" side of the project: consolidating the "ingredients" variables of
the results, estimating their cost, and options to add or remove items from the grocery dataframe.

In the beginning comments of "Master Program.py" are notes of other functionalities considered by the programmer.

/Python-SQL Iteration
This folder is provided to demonstrate familiarity with SQL, specifically SQLite to be integrated with Python.
The files are not intended to be as streamlined or have the same functionality as the Pandas iteration, and 
is not guaranteed to be functional, as it was a catalyst for the Pandas iteration and was not formally finished.
